Mazine is a **Serverless modern image hosting application** built on **Next.js 14** and object storage services, with the following features:

- **No database management**: No longer worry about database failures causing image hosting to go down.
- **Code Hosting**: The project code is hosted on **GitHub** and deployed to **Vercel**.
- **Environment Variable Management**: Passwords and related environment variables must be manually added to Vercel to ensure the security of sensitive information.

## May 31

**üöÄIn short, this is essentially a brand-new project built upon the foundation of the previous UI ‚Äî with a restructured codebase, improved authentication, and refined UI design.**

- **Authentication Upgrade**: The cumbersome JWT-based method has been deprecated in favor of a more efficient and architecture-aligned authentication approach, improving both security and response speed.

- **Half-Screen UI Optimization**: The interface interactions have been refined to better match user habits, offering a smoother and more intuitive experience.

- **Complete Overhaul of Data Management**: A brand-new architecture significantly reduces backend (Vercel Function) calls, resulting in response speeds several times faster. Even under Vercel deployment, the performance now closely matches local execution.

- **Optimized Loading and Caching Logic**: Loading mechanisms have been restructured and caching strategies enhanced to better support the new data management logic, boosting overall system performance and stability.

- **Enhanced Statistics and Notifications**: More detailed statistics and notifications regarding image hosting usage have been added, giving users better insight into uploads and management. The developer console (F12) now also provides concise feedback for quicker diagnostics.


  
### CDN Security and Recommended Configuration

Due to the high risk of password leaks when handling CDN through open-source code, this project does not include any CDN conversion code. It is recommended to manage the CDN using the following methods:

1. **R2 Custom Subdomain**: Secure access by configuring a dedicated R2 subdomain.
2. **Cloudflare Worker**: Use Cloudflare Worker for efficient CDN acceleration and processing.
3. **Alist S3 CDN Functionality**: Leverage Alist integration for easy CDN implementation.

## Features

- üöÄ Based on Next.js 14 App Router
- üì¶ Supports multiple object storage services (S3, Alist, etc.)
- üé® Responsive design + dark mode
- üîí Simple password protection
- üìã One-click copy in multiple formats (URL, Markdown, BBCode)
- üíæ Image compression and WebP conversion
- üñºÔ∏è Supports grid view and timeline view, card-style management and preview
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Image favorites functionality
- üîç Image search feature

## Deployment
---
### 1.Fork this repository

---
### 2. Generate Required Environment Variables for Login

#### a. Generate the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` (JWT Secret Key):

- Visit https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32

- This website will automatically generate a secure random key.

#### b. Generate the environment variable `AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` (Password Hash):

- Visit https://bcrypt-generator.com/

- Enter the desired password.

- Select 10 rounds of encryption.

- Click "Generate" to obtain the hash value.

### 3.Using R2

This project is developed and tested using Cloudflare R2 as the storage bucket, and other S3 buckets have not been tested.  
If using R2 as the storage backend, the configuration example is:

[‚ú°Ô∏èR2-setting-guide, click here!!!!!](/MDs/R2-setting.md)

```
S3_REGION= bucket-region
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
S3_ENDPOINT=http:bucket-endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_CDN=xxx.r2.dev / custom domains
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGUAGE=EN
AUTH_USERNAME=
